WebDev2 Final, Reminder that you said I could create a website for my app.

I faced a lot of challenges in creating this website. I regret the way I structured my prototype because it's not conducive to having the layout changed between breakpoints. Each version (mobile, tablet, desktop) of my prototype was different in a way that made achieving that layout quite difficult to do. It was a really great learning experience though. I contemplated changing my prototype to accommodate my level of coding, but instead, I decided to push myself and experiment with Bootstrap as much as I could. In the end, what I had to do to achieve the layouts was create 3 sections, each with their own class of mobile, tablet, or desktop, and then show/hide them using CSS. Doing that presented its own challenges too, and something I would make changes to the CSS that would cascade into problems across all my breakpoints. It was a huge struggle, but I feel quite proud of what I was able to achieve, especially while having to juggle completing a group project by myself for another class. The video that you can watch on my site is one that I had to create by myself in a very short period. That's why the images I used for my site were stock assets (except for the image of the phone with the app open on it.
